What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","- Data structures are formats for organizing, storing, processing, and retrieving data.\n","- Data structures make it easier to manage large amounts of data.   - Data structures help make code more efficient.\n","- Learning data structures helps you develop problem-solving techniques that can be applied to new frameworks.\n","\n","2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","- Mutable data types can be changed after they are created, while immutable data types cannot.\n","-  **mutable data types **\n","    - Lists: Elements can be added, removed, or changed\n","    - Dictionaries: Values can be changed\n","    - Sets: Values can be changed\n","-** immutable data types **\n","    - Strings: Content cannot be changed after creation\n","    - Tuples: Elements cannot be changed, added, removed, or replaced\n","    -Integers: Values cannot be changed\n","    -Floats: Values cannot be changed\n","\n","3 What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n"," - The main difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.\n","\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","- The dictionary consists of a number of buckets. Each of these buckets contains the hash code of the object that contains the key-value pair. A pointer to the key object and a pointer to the value object.\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","- By definition, sets cannot contain duplicates\n","- Processing speed matters.\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","- A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes. A list is a sequence of items, where each item could be anything\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","- Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability.\n","- This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- In Python, a hash table is a data structure that's used to implement dictionaries.\n","- A hash table stores key-value pairs, and the dictionary data type in Python uses a hash table to store its key-value pairs.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","- Yes,a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, and booleans.\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","- they cannot be changed after they are created since strings can't be changed, we construct *new* strings as we go to represent computed values.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","-  when you need to quickly look up a specific value based on a unique key, as dictionaries use a hash table to enable fast access to data using that key, making them ideal for tasks requiring rapid lookups or mapping between related data points, unlike lists which require sequential searching through elements to find a match.\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","- Use a list if you need a mutable collection of items where you may need to add, remove, or change elements.\n","- Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","- Items of a set in python are immutable (unchangeable), do not duplicate values, and unordered.\n","\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","-  The in operation for the dictionary tests on keys.\n","-The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets.\n","- On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list.\n","\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","- No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are \"immutable\" in most programming languages, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed; attempting to alter a tuple element will result in an error message.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","- A nested dictionary is a data structure where a dictionary itself is used as a value within another dictionary, essentially creating a hierarchy of key-value pairs within a dictionary\n","-  Representing complex data with multiple levels of organization, like storing employee information by department, where each department is a key in the outer dictionary and its employees' details are nested dictionaries within it.\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","- The time complexity of accessing an element in a Python dictionary is (O(1)), which means it's very fast. This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally, which allows for constant time lookup.\n","\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","- If you need an ordered collection, like a sequence of user actions, lists are your go-to.\n","- On the other hand, when you need quick look-ups, like mapping usernames to user data, dictionaries are invaluable.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- Because you dont pull info out based on index like lists.\n","-  The items do not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","- A list retrieves data using its index position (numerical order), while a dictionary retrieves data using a unique key, allowing for direct access to specific values based on their associated key, making dictionary lookups generally faster for large datasets when you need to find a specific piece of information quickly."],"metadata":{"id":"vdOCSBfSn6-f"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1 Write a code to create a string with your name and print it\n","name = \"Priyanka
